# HelloWorld
I am so grateful to have taken this chance to reinvent myself and change my life. I know that things look
a little crazy right now as far as my current situation goes but this is the most excited I've been in 
my entire life. Moving to Atlanta has been my second desire with New York being my first. I fell in love
with it about 9 years ago when I came for the Natural Hair show and have been making strides ever since
to get back here. Never realizing until the growth of the internet that all along this is where the populous
of IT was located. I'm astounded with the major advancements in this era of technology and the advent
of knowledge at your finger tips. So I invite you take this plight with me as I change, grow and learn for the 
rest of my life. This is is me Que'Shetta Denise Manning, aka Queen, aka Que', aka Denise, aka Neicy, aka 
GoddessGeek. I present to you....MY LIFE!!
